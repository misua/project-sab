| 1    | Scaffold Python backend (FastAPI) for receiving and processing audio                      | ✅ Complete |
| 2    | Create simple web client for recording audio and sending to server                        | ✅ Complete |
| 3    | Integrate local speech-to-text (TensorFlow/PyTorch/Whisper)                              | ✅ Complete |
| 4    | Implement custom word mapping and intent recognition                                      | ✅ Complete |
| 5    | Add feedback/confirmation system (web UI and server logic)                                | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 6    | Enable correction & learning loop (parent can correct, server updates mappings/model)     | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 7    | Local data storage (privacy, no cloud)                                                    | ✅ Complete |
| 8    | **Collect natural speech data from both kids (full sentences, play, daily speech)**       | ⬜️ In Progress |
| 9    | **Export and segment audio into individual labeled clips (e.g., using Audacity)**         | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 10   | **Label each audio segment with intended word/phrase (CSV/JSON mapping)**                 | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 11   | Fine-tune speech-to-text model using custom dataset                                       | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 12   | Optimize for speed (quantization/pruning, noise suppression)                              | ⬜️ Not Started |
| 13   | Documentation & usage instructions                                                        | ⬜️ Not Started |
